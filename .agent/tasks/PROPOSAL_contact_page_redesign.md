description: Propose a new Professional Contact Page Layout
---

I have designed a new **"Split-Panel Glassmorphic"** layout for the Contact page. This design is widely used by premium SaaS companies because it is clean, focused, and visually striking.

### The Design Concept
Instead of separate floating cards, we unite everything into **one cohesive central card**:

1.  **Left Panel (The "Brand" Side)**:
    *   **Background**: A deep, rich gradient (aligned with your footer/dark theme elements, e.g., Dark Slate or Emerald).
    *   **Content**: "Get in Touch" header, contact info (Email, Address), and Social Media icons.
    *   **Effect**: This acts as a visual anchor and separates the "informational" context from the "actionable" form.

2.  **Right Panel (The "Form" Side)**:
    *   **Background**: Clean White / Soft Grey.
    *   **Content**: The form fields (Name, Email, Subject, Message) with a clean, pill-shaped Submit button.
    *   **Effect**: Provides a distraction-free area for the user to type.

### Visual Preview
I have generated a mockup image of this concept: `contact_page_split_layout.png` (see above).

### Why this is better?
*   **Cleaner**: Reduces the number of visual elements on the screen from 5-6 cards to just 1 main element.
*   **Professional**: The contrast between the dark info panel and light form panel looks very high-end.
*   **Focus**: Guide's the user's eye naturally from left (context) to right (action).

**Shall I proceed with implementing this new layout?**
